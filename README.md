Small game framework in the C# console.


Launch the "Game" project in visual studio and follow the instructions on the screen.

Some features I implemented so far:

-Collision

-Ai pathfinding

-Ai vision (cannot see through solid objects)

-Item inventory/picking up items (E = pick up, Q = Drop, I = Attack, J = Swap item left, L = Swap item right)

-Level designer (build individual objects/ shift+enter build and entire rectangle of an object)

-Saving levels created in the designer to play later.

-Multiple maps in a level (map = 2d grid where the game takes place, can go to the next one by going over the border)

-Ranged/melee attacks (projectiles)
